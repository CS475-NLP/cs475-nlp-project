hilarious scene one involving hitman diane apparently sees major force behind campaign trying pressure director accept camilla part movie adam party second half movie therefore occupies major part dream feelings guilt remorse towards murder camilla part wants miss turns dumb criminal scene think also lynch attempt totally screwing audience since given false pretence view movie got love something bit bad line though next interesting scene one two persons twinkies conversation one keep recurring nightmare involving man seen wall outside diner sitting little talk head outside keep

diane wake reality reality nightmare unable escape even dreams chilling scene end creepy old couple reappear diane tormented way sees suicide way order escape screams avoid haunted fears anyway hope could help people bashing movie calling worst movie ever something effect without realizing plot usual lynch creating irrational fears certainly achieves picture well
